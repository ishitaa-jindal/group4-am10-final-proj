# Gender Inequality Within Europe

Though things have improved for women in recent years, gender inequalities still appear to remain large. Despite being one of the more progressive regions in terms of gender equality, there are still major disparities between men and women throughout Europe. Through data visualisation, we want to determine how large the inequality is in the top 3 and bottom 3 GII ranking countries in Europe. 

## Objectives: 
- Visualise the pay gap between men and women around the world
- Compare participation in the job market between men and women 
- Determine which countries are best and worst in terms of gender equality 
- Determine female presence in government around the world 
- Look at the different dimensions that are used to calculate the Gender Inequality Index value 

The data we analyse can be found in the data folder.
