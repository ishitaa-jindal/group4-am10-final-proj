# Gender Inequality Around the World

Though things have improved for women in recent years, gender inequalities still appear to remain large. Through data visualisation, we want to determine how large the inequality is in different countries around the world. 

## Objectives: 
Visualise the pay gap between men and women around the world
Compare participation in the job market between men and women 
Determine which countries are best and worst in terms of gender equality 
Determine what types of jobs are held by men and women 
Determine female presence in senior management around the world 

The data we analyse can be found in the data folder.
